        <p>It is time to shatter the perception that the affordable housing crisis is a looming future risk. As this third and final report in our Housing a Generation of Essential Workers series will illustrate, the housing crisis is already costing our regions billions of dollars annually. The reality is that the current government methodologies for increasing affordable housing won’t get us there alone. We need to accelerate current practices and bring private and public sector partners to the table to help solve this crisis.</p>

        <p>This report identifies those costs in the starkest of terms. Nearly $8 billion is being drained out of our economy every year because of housing costs – some of the highest in North America.</p>

        <p>These higher housing costs harm our economy in a number of ways. Some employers pay a “GTA Wage Premium” to retain workers and account for the higher cost of living compared to other parts of Ontario. For industries that cannot pay the premium – often in the broader public sector – their workers are more likely to leave the region or face a punishing commute. The resulting higher rate of employee turnover forces organizations to pay increased recruitment costs and harms their productivity. In many ways, businesses, their employees and families are already bearing the burden of our region’s collective inaction on workforce housing.</p>
